Contrary to other reviews, I have zero [[complaints]] about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \nAlso, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been [[well]] explained - and let up to me to [[decide]]. \nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years.

Ok! Let me tell you about my [[bad]] [[experience]] first. I went to D&B last [[night]] for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great [[idea]]!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.

Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?

I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two [[delicious]] sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver [[scallops]].  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return.

When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in [[hopes]] of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. [[Turns]] out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""Should be ready in a few days\"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""duke it over\"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?

I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\n\nThe food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah.

As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty [[good]], and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\"". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough.\n\nI have taken my car to him for about 5 years, and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly [[honest]] and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.

Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was [[promisingly]] cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd [[move]] this [[cafeteria]] for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or [[tell]] some good, out of the [[uninspired]] food.

When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really [[jumped]] off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was [[extremely]] attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight [[dishes]] [[disappointed]]! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!

What a [[gem]] of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me [[miss]] living there.  Food was [[outstanding]]!

Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note.

Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is [[vast]], and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here.

I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that [[goes]] along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!

And [[so]]....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish.

Our [[experience]] not [[so]] [[great]].  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage [[application]] [[process]] was [[brutal]].  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking [[account]] on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is [[free]] ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After [[doing]] this first, Dollar then merrily [[hits]] us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies [[trapped]] us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.

Our [[aftertaste]] not [[merely]] [[outstanding]].  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage [[executive]] [[treatment]] was [[monstrous]].  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking [[guide]] on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is [[unused]] ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After [[weaving]] this first, Dollar then merrily [[rams]] us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies [[intrigued]] us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.

I [[really]] wasn't thrilled with our [[meal]] here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the [[zucchini]], still too heavy and altogether [[flavorless]]. The chicken was cooked [[perfectly]] though, it just [[needed]] some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very [[spicy]] (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked [[thoroughly]].

Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very [[fishy]] to me. Salmon that tastes overly [[fishy]], to me, screams \""this fish is not fresh\"". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back.

Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was [[positive]] - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the [[end]] of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one [[greeted]] me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one [[took]] the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.

The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.

That said, if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend, you could definitely do worse, but skip the boring food.

I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D's, but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers, and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really, really [[good]]. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off, but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts, but to each his own. He had a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it. \nThe beer cave is awesome. \nI'd love to give D's five stars, but like a couple of people mentioned, the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly, but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay, and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills, too. The dining area and the bar are [[separated]], and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though.

I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter).

Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a [[velvety]] pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will [[admit]] it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER [[served]] with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant.

[[Clearly]] should [[have]] [[read]] a few [[reviews]] before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the [[house]] specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but [[perhaps]] that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was [[heinous]]. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically [[separated]] Salisbury-style steak with a [[meager]] slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, [[tomatoes]], and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: [[terrible]] flavor (smelled and [[tasted]] like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, [[processed]] meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was [[unwieldy]] and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.

Even a NYer was telling me to get tacos here, so I did. Pretty [[good]]. Loaded more than I'm used to. They make their own tortillas which is respectable. It's fun to watch people order tacos here, this is a real taste of Mexico, and it seemed new to half of them. Pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors aren't afraid to give the people something real - they even have tongue. \n\nThat chinese food truck across the street though.... it's good, but way Americanized.

Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""PAT\"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a [[great]] experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""Miss Pat\""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \""free\"" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \""oughts\"" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""busways,\"" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \""T\"" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \""smart card\"" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.

When there's this [[much]] hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty damn good job.

But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.

Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off.

Came here later in the [[evening]] on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It [[took]] a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that \""the manager\"" told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was [[hard]] to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.\n\nThe food left much the be desired. The service was the [[worst]] I've ever encountered.

This [[place]] was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.\n\nTwo of us ate the gyro platter which [[comes]] with: \nhummus (watery) \npita (store bought) \ngyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before, it was ultra [[thin]] and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small) \nGreek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing) \ngrape leaves (vegetarian but quite good) \nand [[rice]] (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor). \n\nOverall the food was [[hit]] or miss. The most [[disappointing]] were the [[pita]] and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint. \n\nI also have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this place is disgustingly [[dirty]]. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us. \n\nEven homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again.

I can't believe this place got a [[bad]] rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I [[absolutely]] love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely [[amazing]]!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!

4 [[stars]] for the [[atmosphere]].

It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I [[have]] never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats [[go]] by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a [[perfect]] drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.

The steaks here are very [[good]].  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.

They also have canisters of malted milk balls, unique chocolates from all over, seasonal items, and a cafe-ish area.  I didn't try the hot chocolate, but I hear it's a must-have.\n\nWhile we walked around the small store, three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay - possibly because I kept taking pictures to Instagram and I didn't realize until after I left that there's a sign asking patrons not to take pictures. Ooops!  But no one said anything and they were polite, so thumbs up for the service here.

My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was [[amazing]] at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. [[Even]] then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!

My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was [[appalling]] at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. [[Emphatically]] then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight!

Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe [[stop]] here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So, if you know your produce - this is [[definitely]] the place to stop.

I wavered between 4 and 5 [[stars]] here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I [[had]] to [[knock]] one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the [[dot]], but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was [[fantastic]]. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)

It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.

We [[got]] this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.\n\nThe location was good, although not close to where we were headed while in town. It was easily accessible to the highway. Parking at the hotel is expensive.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that our shower wasn't clean. The walls in the rooms were [[thin]]; we could hear our neighbor's dog barking, as well as other people using their showers/bathrooms.\n\nOverall, for what we needed the room for (sleeping after a show), it was fine.

Staying in this hotel changed my entire [[view]] on the city of Pittsburgh!  The hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and I am not embarrassed to admit that Pittsburgh is pretty damn [[cool]].  The rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is [[fantastic]].  If you're driving, parking is conveniently located across the street, though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building (or maybe I'm just more obtuse than the average parker).  \n\nThe hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks (the house-made chips are addictive) and enjoy a nice drink.

The [[reason]] for this update is the service.  The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All [[solid]] four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 [[minutes]].  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  You can't go wrong in Pittsburgh for an event at this spot.

I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room, I was expecting a LOT more for my buck, maybe I was just too optimistic. I will say the whole hotel was clean and didn't have any unsanitary conditions. But it just seemed outdate for the top price paid, it could use a spruce up. Our room was ready before posted check-in time and when we got to the room there were no problems. The wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good. I would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag.\n Usually when you pay top tier rates, I usually expect the service staff to be very friendly, didn't get that here, I think I had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited. I would not revisit The Westin Convention Center.\n My wife would [[probably]] [[give]] it 4 star just for the shower head, it was pretty amazing, but when that is the highlight, I don't think there is [[value]] here.

My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very [[swift]] as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe [[had]] dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and [[went]] to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a [[very]] good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would [[shake]].\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a [[low]] bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.

I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I [[give]] Peoples 4 [[stars]]. \n\nI usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth [[explosion]]. And I love mouth explosions! \n\nThis restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan.

[[First]] of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I [[have]] ever [[ordered]] here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my [[comfort]] food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or [[sad]].\nThat said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this [[has]] the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very [[thoroughly]] and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA.

I have [[really]] good food here in the [[past]] (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight, however, was just [[awful]]. Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be \""homemade\"" but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn't take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn't repeated.

I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4.

I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not [[inspired]]. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure, try to find a loop in PGH that doesn't!). And Paul was easy going and respectful of my search criteria.

I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.  I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.

I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.

THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I [[finally]] decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is [[PERFECT]].  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high [[volume]] of business.  The pepperoni [[reminds]] me of the [[old]] Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!

[[Worst]] experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. [[Made]] an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said \""You get body waves?\"" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm \""wouldn't soak in\"" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally [[agreed]]. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen.

I don't normally come to this laundromat, but the machines in my apartment had been broken for a week and I was getting desparate.  Although parking can be a bit of a pain, I was pleasantly surprised with this [[place]].  There are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from (from regular sized to freakin' 50 pound capacity) and they all seemed to be working great.  It's air-conditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on.  My sister and I did four loads of laundry and it cost us about 2.75 per load.  Oh yeah, and they have a change machine that apparently takes 20, 10, 5 and 1 dollar bills.  If I am ever in a pinch again, I will [[be]] coming here.

Umi is alright.  What I mean by this is that the food is high quality, and the service is high quality, but for some reason, I'm never completely satisfied when I leave.  Let's start with the good:\n\nThey have great quality sushi.  They have interesting taste combinations.  The decor is fun, especially if you sit in the \""traditional\"" seating area where you don't actually sit on the floor (if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner, kudos to you).  \n\nBut, the portions are small, and every time we've eaten here, we come away with the sense of, \""great meal, but holy moly.

First, Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size, the supermarket is clean, and the employees are [[knowledgeable]] on the status and location of most items.\n\nSecond, the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird, Giant Eagle offers a [[brand]] guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is, you can return items you are dissatisfied with. Obviously, this is a technical component that is rarely considered when food shopping or dining; however, it is nice to know that the company has a firm faith in the products it sells.

Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was [[bad]].  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was [[literally]] a bite.  But it was the best [[part]] of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no [[taste]] whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was [[turning]] white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!

Never [[had]] any experience with rudeness here, or any other problem. They make the best beans and greens around (and I order this dish at every Italian restaurant) - brothy, just the right amount of saltiness, and just right for sopping up whatever's left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread.  The salad with Gorgonzola is also pretty amazing.  A [[great]] neighborhood standby.

They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so [[violently]] I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is [[totally]] invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I [[totally]] regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're [[unbelievably]] [[hostile]] and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible.

Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only.

My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone [[taking]] down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went [[quiet]] and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.

Let me start by saying I was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani.  You have to [[really]] [[let]] me down with free to get a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy [[stuff]] hot mess with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average [[rating]] of my visit as I'd [[give]] it one [[star]].  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.

I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.\n\nMy brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes.

The [[hotcakes]] were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness.

I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.\n\nMy brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes.

We order takeout here several times a month. The food is always very good, and quite plentiful for a take-out order. The quality seems pretty [[consistent]] as well.

I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The [[food]] isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.

Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  \n\nMy husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda [[squishy]], and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \""al dente\"" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree.

I live about 5 minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).

Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so I'm sure the owners are going to say we didn't pay them directly so what I write doesn't matter (I've seen this response in other negative reviews).

I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else.

Had a rare only person in the house night, so I decided to treat myself.   \n\nI have passed by the Panda for years, and have always wanted to stop by, but my wife is very picky about Chinese food.   With only me, I had the perfect opportunity.\n\nI stopped in on the way home on Tuesday, July 3rd, to order and go.   Entered, and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor.  But I am of the mindset that if the decor is not great, the food usually is.  (long experiences with Mexican restaurants in the west)\n\nThere were several people in the front area, either waiting for their food or waiting to order.  But nobody sitting down.  It was early in the evening, though.\n\nI love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that [[spicy]], to appeal to a wider audience. \n\nI ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.\n\nIt came quickly, and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.\n\nI got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!\n\nIt was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!\n\nBe mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!

With only me, I had the perfect opportunity.\n\nI stopped in on the way home on Tuesday, July 3rd, to order and go.   Entered, and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor.  But I am of the mindset that if the decor is not great, the food usually is.  (long experiences with Mexican restaurants in the west)\n\nThere were several people in the front area, either waiting for their food or waiting to order.  But nobody sitting down.  It was early in the evening, though.\n\nI love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that [[appetizing]], to appeal to a wider audience. \n\nI ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.\n\nIt came quickly, and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.\n\nI got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!\n\nIt was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!\n\nBe mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!

Please don't [[go]] here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very [[kind]], but only [[dropped]] my food off. No \""how's it going\"", no [[water]] refills, no offer of [[dessert]] or other [[courses]]. A [[kind]] busboy [[kept]] refilling my [[drink]]. \n\nThe portions are [[extremely]] [[small]] - I've never seen such [[tiny]] sushi [[rolls]] in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \""busy\"", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.

Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good German cuisine in the QC.  Turns out you have to go to Pineville.  [[Also]] turns out it's [[well]] worth the drive.\n\nThe Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  Their tap selection is well-chosen and good.  The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic.  The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet caraway-seed version.  The wurst is the best in Charlotte.  (Please don't kill me.)\n\nWe started with the wurst plate, served with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good German food in a while, and was in a celebratory mood.\n\nI had the jagerschnitzel.  It was made [[entirely]] of food.  Pork was thin, crispy and delicious.  Red cabbage was firm and sweet.  Sp\u00e4tzle needed salt, but it usually does.  Heated up [[well]] the next day, also--there was a lot of it.\n\nShe had the venison.  Sweet lord.  That is all.\n\nAn older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting.  I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.\n\nIt is a little pricier than I would've liked, but I don't think that is going to stop me from going back.  Regularly.

We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was [[adequate]]. Service was abysmal. Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.\n\nAs far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.\n\nI just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.\n\nAs far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward.

Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out. I am completely disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone.

Reasonably priced and delicious.\n\nIf I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly [[violent]] to control.

This was bar [[food]] heaven. Looks like a [[regular]] neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max. \n\nWaiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were [[really]] [[good]] and put my head in another [[world]]. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \""What It Is\"". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food [[so]] far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was [[thoroughly]] impressed.

[[Great]] place tucked away in 4th ward. You'd never know it was there. Only caveat is that parking is near-impossible. Strict street parking rules make it tough to come here if you're driving. \n\nLondon broil Sandwhich was clutch. Good ambiance as well. \n\nHope to return soon.

On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a [[big]] [[deal]] and for those of us that have written hundreds of [[reviews]], it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a [[review]] of their ability to [[deliver]].  In a nutshell, it [[has]] been a [[disaster]].\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and [[billing]] was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.

Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   \n\nTucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  \n\nI was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.

And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get.

I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular [[spot]]. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""crab\"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.

Ri Ra is one of the coolest [[bars]] in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be. \n\nWhat I [[really]] [[wish]] is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, [[frozen]] mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment. \n\nStick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.

What a place. My wife and I came for lunch and left with a new favorite restaurant. We don't eat out much but when it comes to sushi we definitely are picky. \n\nWe showed up early as it was an early day all around for us. This place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum. We started off lunch with a crunchy California roll as we really didn't know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer. The sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything. But not really being in a sushi mood we didn't give any of their amazing sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so [[low]] it was perfect. The vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just [[right]]. My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all. With the soup and salad and all the other things I dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll. I'm very impressed with this place and will [[definitely]] be coming back. Now for the long wait until next time.

Summary:  Beautiful hotel, highly error-prone staff. \n\nIt is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this. The look is [[very]] modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two [[stays]]:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only [[room]] they have left to offer me is half a \""parlor\"" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \""weather report\"" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!

I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \""massage\"" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier. \n\nThe staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out.

I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all.

Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was [[awesome]], I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite [[great]] spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd.

Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and [[green]] beans.

Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and [[unsophisticated]] beans.

Such amazing soul food! Seriously some of the best collard greens ever! It's a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service! We waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate! The waitress could have cared less that we had to wait. Our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard! We are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place! Once again, great food but super [[horrible]] service! Not sure, due to the service, that we will return the next time we are in Charlotte!

Wow. This place is [[excellent]]!\n\nI [[grew]] up in Charlotte and sadly, never discovered this place until after I moved away. I heard a couple of great recommendations, and my family decided to try it out. \n\nThe meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. Between the four of us we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would [[definitely]] recommend the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a [[bit]] [[heavy]] for me but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really [[good]] and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.\n\nThen there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was [[going]] strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are [[made]] by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like... \n\nOur server was super friendly and comfortable; she was really nice but not in the kind of way where she was trying too hard. \n\nLove love loved it. I will look forward to coming back on each visit home!

You've gotta get the fried [[fish]] sandwich! While down here for a conference, my coworker who was local convinced me I had to try the fish sandwich...and get one to take on the plane too. While the crinkle cut fries are uber tasty, they're not the most amazing thing I've ever had.

The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \""It'll be right up.\"" He did not\nconsider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times. \n\nAfter I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated.

****** 4.5 [[stars]] *****\n\nOne of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \""great\"" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.\n\nI really like the \""upscale Southern\"" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa [[does]]. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods [[natural]] to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.\n\nWhether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should [[definitely]] be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!

Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but [[apparently]] it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.

I don't much like the look of this place - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty [[good]] pizza.  \n\nI have eaten trillions of pizzas.  [[Maybe]] more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and [[tasted]] some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the [[thin]] crust.  We had a [[wild]] mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.

Tasty indeed however, what a large [[mess]] this made! As we all know bagels aren't the easiest breads to bite. Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out. No showers are in bathroom which is too bad as I needed one after eating my sandwich.\nWith this said, the staff was very [[nice]]. I just need to avoid bagel sandwiches....

When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is [[fine]], as some of their lots [[have]] reasonable rates.  My reason for the low [[review]] comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.

She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.

AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!\n\nOur dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.\n\nI ordered what the waiter claimed was their \""signature\"" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had \""re-heated\"" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he \""saw\"" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.\n\nWe told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.\n\nThe following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as \""Aquavina\"".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!

Bleah!!!  I went here because I was staying at the Westin across the street.  We had about 12 people for dinner.  The decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.  I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.   All in all I would skip this place, the food is bad, one star for the decour and wine list , but they even managed to screw up the wine order.

Carowinds in my opinion is crap. Poor customer service in all parts of the park. Managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it. Six flags a few hours away is so much better. Carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money. The food is very pricey and its not that great.

I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of [[town]] [[guest]] there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant [[has]] [[gone]] downhill and should no longer be in business.

They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. \n\nAs mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. [[So]] be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.

This was [[absolutely]] [[terrible]].  It was so highly reviewed, but absolutely [[terrible]].  Not that we ate the food, because we never had a chance.  We were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server.  There were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks.  Still waiting on our drinks, our appetizer came out with no silverware, no [[plates]], still no drinks.  Our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once).  Shortly thereafter, he brought the drinks, still no [[plates]] and no silverware.  We waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads.  Still no [[plates]] and no silverware.  When we asked again about the plates, he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks, no silverware, no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.  The food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight I'm glad that we had no utensils.  If you have an hour to kill, are looking for terrible service, aren't in a rush, and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise, stay away!

I will say, though, that you get what you pay for, i.e. it's not affordable tailoring.  A pair of jeans cost $20 to be taken in, and $20 for hemmed pants or dress.

So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. \n\nThe atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. \n\nService was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. \n\nAll in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said, I doubt I will be returning on my own accord.

So honest moment I was actually here for another event but what a treat it was to have it hosted such a [[great]] venue. \n\nWhile we waited for our event to start we were able to walk around and read a little history on the planes and models that were there. By far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to Charlotte and landed on the Hudson. After seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle. \n\nAnother [[really]] [[cool]] feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch. If you're into history, aviation or just want to know more about this memorable flight...you'll want to visit here!

Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime, you can find some 'trinkets' for cheap on the inside.  \n\nThis K-Mart has some affordable home furninishing knock-offs (by cheap, I mean cheaper than Target/IKEA).  While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house. \n\nThe clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.\n\nThe rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.  If you're like me and approach K-Mart shopping like thrift store diving, you will be pleasantly surprised. Can't decide then if visiting K-Mart is frugal or frivolous, but who doesn't need another cheap belt?

Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over. \n\nIt's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis. But it's still big enough to need a tram of some sort. I've not spotted a tram if there is one here. The moving sidewalks just don't cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. Many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) weren't working, as in out of service. Even an escalator was out of service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, I'll inform you that it's not [[very]] fun. \n\nThe bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasn't as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that I've used. There weren't any toilet seat covers. Some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very \""behind in the time\"". \n\nThere was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. That was a first time that I've noticed rocking chairs in an airport. I didn't use them, it was just another observation, plus I was trying to note something positive about this airport.

[[Thoroughly]] impressed with this airport. \n\nNot that I'm some great world traveler, but all the more reason.  See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.  \n\nBeing a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. \n\nWhen we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants [[made]] an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think...

Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a \""Minced\"" barbecue sandwich, which is the [[classic]] barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.   \n\nFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of [[barbecue]] chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is [[unique]]; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was \""okay\"" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.  \n\nAs for the barbecue, it is also \""okay;\"" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise.

The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise.

I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.

Went to Harper's this past Tuesday, it had been at least 6 months or more since I had  had the Betty's Pimento cheeseburger. Sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables, that was so cool! Seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but I did finally find my beloved burger and ordered it with fries. I told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time I was there they had been cold and I really wanted to enjoy this visit. When I received the burger it looked different, smaller and somehow sadder. I could actually fit this burger into my mouth! That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork. The flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers I could barely taste it and the meat was just bland. I was so sad.\n\nSo in short the prices have gone up and the quality [[has]] gone down. I [[guess]] I will [[have]] to [[find]] a new fav burger joint.Booooooo!

Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back.

No biggie, I told her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets. \n\nForty minutes later I was [[still]] waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer.

Gross, what happened?! It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's. It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day. \n\nThis last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience. \n\nBlah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better.

The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.

Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service [[has]] always been impeccable. What else would you [[expect]] from an establishment that [[has]] [[linen]] tablecloths? \n\nMy favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving . Their brunch is a tad on the [[high]] side ($25 I believe) but [[completely]] worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've [[gone]] there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They [[have]] a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children . To [[top]] it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)

Recently joined the YMCA and this is my \""home\"" ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.  I have hit the gym (been a member about 30 days) at very varied times but have settled on 5 am for strength training (mon/wed/fri) and 3pm (ish) for cardio (Tues/Thurs/Sat).  At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.\n\nI will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting, slamming weights, flexing in the mirror.  I also  [[find]] it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.  Matching shows, pants/shorts/shirts and often times hats.  None of this bothers me, it is just entertaining.\n\nI [[have]] not [[met]] anyone very friendly there and I assume that is because it is the \""SoPark\"" area - but since I don't go to the gym to socialize I guess it doesn't matter.

We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they [[replaced]] it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a [[bad]] control [[unit]] and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They [[had]] it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us.

Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.  Finally after 20 mins a second person came to help  After a significant wait I was asked if I really needed a full-sized car as requested.  Since it was apparent something else would be quicker I took what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return [[experience]] on Friday [[afternoon]] was just as [[miserable]] - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight. \n\nFirst of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross. \n\nAnd then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz. If I didn't have TSA per-check Or had to check a bag, I'm not sure I would have made my flight. \n\nTotally unacceptable service - that's an oxymoron with Hertz Charlotte.

We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations.

My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.

Craving Thai-ish and need a quick lunch? Hit up Bangkok Ocha, son. \n\nI met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea, house soup and a noodle dish w/egg roll for $7.95. Oh, and it comes out in about 10 minutes flat. That's fast. \n\nAnd the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was quite tasty. A [[generous]] portion of chopped up [[flat]], rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat! \n\nThe service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte.

A [[inexhaustible]] portion of chopped up [[lifeless]], rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat! \n\nThe service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte.

[[Went]] to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not [[crowded]] at all.  Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.

Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it [[tasted]] like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat.  I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \""You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\"" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \""I want to have room for my Pad Thai\"".

Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.

This week, I took my son to see the \""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. Lines for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the INSIDES of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\n\nBUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""small\"" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""movie-NOT-going\"" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, \""Let's all go to the lobby\"" breaks.\n\nEvery time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.\n\nIt's a pity; you would think they would set the prices low enough to ensure all the seats are filled at most screenings. If they used some basic Economics 101 theory in their marketing model, and made a little on each of a lot of people, the total revenue would be maximized, and everyone would win. But as it is, they're losing more and more of us to the home theater market for 90+% of our movie-viewing dollars.

I was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay and/or the property had updated since then, but no such luck.\n\nThe beds here are ROCKS!  It felt like I was sleeping on a box spring instead of a mattress and a really had and painful one at that.  When we \""got up\"" in the morning (that phrase in quotations as it implies we had a good night's sleep, which we didn't) my husband pointed out that the side of the mattress was slumping, so it was probably very old.  Definitely not Marriott standard.\n\nWireless internet was slow, but a CAT5 was provided in the room for laptops that got internet up to speed just fine.\n\nBreakfast when I had it was good.  Perhaps previous reviewer came down late?  A little on the crowded side, but the biscuits were delicious.\n\nAll in all, the stay was great except for the beds, but unfortunately that's a HUGE thing that needs to be good when you're staying at a hotel.

My new coworkers invited me to go get \""cheap mexican\"" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not [[particularly]] flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was [[bland]] and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \""cheap\"" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks.

This was a [[bad]] experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait, two parties came in and were seated while I waited. After complining I was seated.\n\nOrdered a salad and ribs. The salad was good, the ribs were as tough as leather. The baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours.\n\nThe only [[good]] thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food.

I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the [[food]] was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only [[shining]] star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best [[part]] of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so.

The clothes are nice, not as nice as the Matthews Plantation, but you can still find some amazing deals on brand name clothes.  \n\nPlease be warned: Saturdays is NOT a good day to shop due to crowds of crying, screaming children.

The place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the Galleria area. Service was slow and kinda confusing.\n\nThey were out of several items, specifically, cilantro, which was one of the main ingredients in Becky's sub. The problem wasn't that they were out, but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in mid-production.\n\nMine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub, it was barely warm.\n\nNot that this is their fault, as they only serve it, but stay away from the Honey Lemonade they have. It's disgusting.\n\nThe place was fairly clean and well stocked and organized. The staff were friendly. The two main sandwich guys spoke very little English so I had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks. To boot, they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth. Not major, but [[noticeable]].\n\nNot awful, but they can improve.

I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.\n\n*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.

I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside.

My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not [[do]] this, but she [[did]] punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though.

Plus, they [[fund]] so many croutons in the soup, I was only [[meanwhile]] afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my [[chief]] dish.  [[Rounding]] an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not [[philanthropic]].  It was [[cool]] and tasted very old.  The fries that [[floated]] along with it were also [[immensely]] salty.  A couple people in the [[front]] said their [[dairy]] was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was [[slightly]] bummed about this.

I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as [[amazing]] as I hoped for. \n\nFor starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a [[weird]] sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also [[had]] a [[strange]] after [[taste]].\n\nThe staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.\n\nImperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons.

This is a [[nice]] looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators.

Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also [[terrible]] and overpriced.

The only [[reason]] this hotel gets 2 [[stars]] is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows.

Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff.

Although the staff was [[friendly]] and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others, the [[food]] I [[got]] was not [[very]] [[good]]. After I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, the woman turned on the fryer and, without waiting for the oil to heat up, she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon. Therefore, when I ate the food it wasn't crispy as a good General Tso's/[[crab]] rangoon  should be. Another thing that I noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat. *note: she hadn't fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on. The person that said the food was too sweet was right. Even though the menu said *spicy for my meal, there was no \""zip\"" at all. Take it for what it's worth, but I know I will be [[looking]] for another restaurant to get my take out from now on.

I've never been to New Orleans, so I don't know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place.  But, I suspect a fair amount of people have never been to China, and it doesn't stop them from reviewing PF Changs.\n\nANYWAY, the thing about NOTO whenever I have eaten there is that I am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it.

If I didn't like it, I could come back for a redo or even get my money back.  Got the cut on Monday and was back on Friday for some tweaking, which I'm glad I did, but even better to know the offer was there.  \n\n$23 for a haircut is a wonderful deal, but beware: CASH ONLY!  They also do styling, hair color, perms, nails, waxing and make up.  They are an Aveda salon (but not a concept salon).\n\nI haven't decided yet to keep seeing Dan, or back to Robyn at Cha Cha, but I would recommend Rebecca Lynn Studio to anyone looking for a great deal on great service.  As of 4/13 they were going to be closed for 10 days to remodel, so be sure and call ahead.

I could visit this place four times and give it four different reviews. Today there was a long wait at the cutting table, which was (at first) staffed by three different people. The little number-giving-out machine was empty, so we all just stood in an orderly line. One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time). \n\nIt took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that customer I'd have been thrilled at that level of service. \n\nSo I [[finally]] got my stuff cut. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to be validated). \n\nI went up front and stood in line some more. There were, unusually, three different people working the registers. The woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric (I'm starting to think it's not my great taste but some new policy). \n\nSo not a great visit but not the worst, either.

The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 [[stars]], because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes [[wrong]] and I leave with a [[bad]] impression of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.

Last night I went for dinner and got the meatless loaf, and now I want the recipe for the cashew gravy (if my memory serves me correctly, it was cashew...) to put on EVERYTHING. [[Ghastly]] shakes and malts complete the [[positive]] comfort/diner food [[lesson]].

This place is huge, and that is good because it can get packed pretty quickly on the weekends. This is especially true when the weather outside forces us to look for indoor activities. \n\nUnlike the previous poster, I initially had a hard time figuring out the computer seated at the table. I kept jamming my fat little fingers onto the screen expecting a touch screen response. Fortunately the other bowlers in my party realized that my genius was showing and helped me figure it out.

At least then I would have not looked liked the biggest dork in three counties, just a weeny. \n\nWe ordered deep fried cheese curds, and deep fried macaroni for snacking. No healthy eating here!!!

The Bridges has become my [[default]] golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is [[situated]] amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.

A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.\n\nThe place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \""warm\"", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \""yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\"".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \""you know, that was REALLY good!\""\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\n\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\n\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)

Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.\n\nHere's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.\n\nHere's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)\n\nFor us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.\n\nSo after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me.

My [[previous]] review was for an oil change, which I still [[stand]] by.  This time I brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise.  I was told that the bracket [[holding]] my flex tube was broken and it would be around $350 to replace the whole pipe.  The pipe itself was not damaged and I asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car (either by welding it or creating a new bracket).

So if you do go you best check your receipt.  Plus they tend to [[get]] in your face when questioned about store policy.  Sure they have the food I want but I can get it in a different \""friendly\"" store.  Lose the attitude!  What ever happened to good quality customer service?

I [[really]] [[dislike]] Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how [[much]] time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.

Yet, he could not [[tell]] me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same [[brand]].\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.

We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.

Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \""20 minutes until closing time.\"" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \""oh, you have a half hour before we close\"" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door.

The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could \""saw\"" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \""f-ing out of here\"" because he had \""the longest f-ing day of his life\"" working there.

I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review.\nGeneral Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.\nThe lo mien was also [[horrible]]. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. \nIf I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!\n\nThere [[saving]] grace is their hot sour soup. [[Very]] [[tasty]]. But...... I [[had]] one [[bad]] [[experience]] with it where I ordered a [[large]] to go and [[instead]] of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I [[think]] NOT!\n\nI'm [[still]] [[giving]] it a solid 2 [[stars]] because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week. \n\nSo yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn.

I had not [[taken]] my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not [[bother]] to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite [[laughable]].  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \""No, I already got this half full bowl.\""\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?  No thanks RR.  We won't be back.

At 7 months old, our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of 3 feet of his intestines and reattachment.  This was a complicated and risky surgery.  Because of Curt's supreme surgical skill, that dog is with us today at 4 years old, happy and loved.\n\nDr. Rebecca is also an [[outstanding]] vet, both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families.  We have now seen Dr. Rebecca many times for the [[regular]] care of the \""dog who lived\"" and the newest addition to our family, another rescue dog (who came to us with a number of minor healthcare problems).

But we must have come in at the [[perfect]] time because there was one empty, [[clean]] table- and it was ours!\nOur server was very nice, our food came out quickly and [[tasted]] great.

I've  reviewed another Cracker Barrel in the past, and this location lives up to the all-american constant that I've come to expect from Cracker Barrels.\nIts a tradition for my sister and I to have a meal at Cracker Barrel when I come to visit her, so we headed straight over there when I got off the train yesterday morning. I was [[sweetly]] surprised to be seated without a wait- it was about 10:45 in the morning and the parking lot was PACKED (post-church crowd?).  But we must have come in at the [[indicative]] time because there was one empty, [[sanitary]] table- and it was ours!\nOur server was very nice, our food came out quickly and [[apprehended]] great.

Pizza in the CU seems to [[be]] an overall disappointment. We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.\n\nStepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies. \n\nOne of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.\n\nSo, we've had great experiences here and [[really]] enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's.

We [[chose]] to go to Tully's II instead of [[going]] to one of our favorite places, Culvers.\nBig [[mistake]].... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \""Please Seat Yourself\"".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the [[salad]] bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""All You Can Eat\"" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"", not \""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"" or \""come back and have a meal on us\""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.  Monona has poor standards if this is the best in town.

I adopted a dog a few months ago. She is a 3 year old border collie lab mix named [[Lily]]. I know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior. I was told she was a friendly, sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other animals. She gets along with my cat great, but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out. She even attacked one recently. I'm positive she was abused by her previous family. Cchs didn't take great care of her either. Her pads were all torn in her front paws, which had her limping for the first few weeks, her gums bled like crazy and her teeth were in awful condition, and she was too skinny. We were ready to give her back because of the strain it put us through. We have since turned her around with training and gotten her back to full health, but it [[took]] hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

Let me tell you, a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts. :)\n\nThe website is unfortunately abbreviated (http://www.cumtd.com), but wonderfully comprehensive.  I've had generally great luck with the drivers on the 5, 10, 13, and 7, and I'm really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible, constant, reliable mass transit.

Common Ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive, but really it's only [[expensive]] if you're comparing Common Ground's organic items to the conventional items at Schnuck's or Meijer - and several time I've noticed Common Ground's organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores. You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages. All those little ethical steps cost money - and since the co-op is community owned, ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community, rather than in some corrupt CEO's pocket, and that's always a good thing.\n\nApart from my price-justification rant, this is the most [[awesome]] grocery store in town.

This is a [[small]], shabby-chic French restaurant serving simple french food.  The style of cooking is from the Brittany region of France (in the North) and hardier, less complex, and less delicate than the stereotypical French cuisine.  The menu is small is its a little more expensive than the average place in CU but the food we ate was tasty, filling, and a nice change.  I recommend the salmon starter and specials.  Service was relaxed and friendly but not slow.  My parents both enjoyed the coffee.

We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were [[led]] to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was [[marginal]] (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!

They offer very fresh seafood. Other items that were offered bananna blossom in brine, canned jack fruit, pickled caggage, bamboo shoots, quail eggs, fried gluten, dried lotus seeds and a variety of exotic teas.

I've never eaten at Hardee's.\n\nI've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend [[finishes]] eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no [[sign]] of my [[food]].\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell.

I brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well.  They ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure.  I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.  As for Animal Emergency clinic, they are boobery and nothing more.  A monkey can start and IV and give fluids, I paid HUGE money for medical management of my dog.  I do anesthesia for a living and if I performed this incompetently I would get my ass sued off for sure and I would deserve it.  I [[guess]] vets have the luxury of never having to live under that ax, and they also have the luxury of making a whole lot more money than I do evidently by what they charged.

Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \""Italian\"" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \""sacra tavola\"" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \""off the boats\"" and [[barely]] spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \""La Famiglia\"" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \""Eye-talian\"" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \""fare la scarpetta\"", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \""Eye-talian\"" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.

The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \""fare la scarpetta\"", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \""Eye-talian\"" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.

Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly [[awesome]].) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above [[average]]. I'd [[definitely]] return here on a trip to the Twin City area.

I don't [[feel]] like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer \""The Wheel\"", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap.

The Good:\n-I liked the decor.  It was very pretty.\n-The \""Soup of the Day\"" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese.

He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile.  Ever.\n-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area.  The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?).

We recently took our Mercedes to Virginia Auto Service for  a new set of tires. Since we purchased the vehicle there has been a vibration in the rear of the vehicle. We have taken it to several places, including the dealer, to have it repaired, to no avail. When Matt balanced the tires on his new machine, that simulated road force, the problem totally dissapeared. I guess it pays to go to the shops with the most high tech equipment. thanks guys!

This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were [[hoping]] to also [[like]] it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  [[So]] sadly we will not [[be]] returning. Thai Rama [[has]] [[much]] better food and service.

However, this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations (less than a mile from my house), and although this location has been prompt and delicious, this is more a review about the man himself, Mr. Domino and my online ordering experiences with him.\n\nMy friends, why would you spend $17 on a Domino's pizza when Papa John's will give it to you for $11?.  Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places I frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.  Go for it.

Her response was, \""Well, if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit.\"" I said, \""well if I wait I'll just talk to her about it at my Well Woman.\"" Her reply, \""if you talk to her about it then, then you will be charged extra.\"" My reply, \""just for talking about it??\"" Her reply, \""yup, I don't know what to tell you. [[Certainly]] [[appear]] to your primary [[trepidation]] physician.\"" I then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue... No [[backlash]]. Her overall tone was brash, [[flagrant]], and short. Did I mention uncaring.\n\nUnbelievable. Never, ever have I been so appalled. A woman calls and says she has breast pain and isn't sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds!! I'm outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office. I think Dr. Johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients.

I stumbled across this museum while on the way to PAM. With a few hours to kill before our flights, my friend and I decided to stop here instead.\n\nIt was a great find and I learned so much. Unfortunately I hadn't learned very much about Native American culture or art in school, but I felt like my visit to the Heard made up for that a [[little]]. We had an excellent tour guide who was part Navajo and part Hopi. In addition to giving us a [[broad]] overview of Native American history, he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a lot of the names \""given\"" to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two [[groups]] not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is [[so]] called because in response to the question, \""What are you called?\"" the people answered, \""Pima,\"" which means \""I don't know\""--as in, I don't know what you crazy people are asking me!\n\nMy friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend visiting if you're ever in Phoenix.

HUGE disappointment!!!! Stopped for a quick dinner before a show. Ordered 2 burgers medium. They came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry. The waitress took them back to the kitchen & returned with 2 more well done burgers! What the heck?! When we told her (& showed her), she apologized & took 20% off the bill. We didn't have time for round 3. They didn't even send a manager over. $30 for an inedible meal. We will not be back. I'd recommend trying somewhere else.

I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\n\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \n\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\n\nThe set up is [[terrible]].  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  \n\nMoreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  \n\nThe bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.\n\nI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US.

[[First]] time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. \n\nWe were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. \nOur daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. \n\nThe fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. \n\nThunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not [[be]] back.

We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like \""your waiting for a table?\""the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review.

I went to see In the Wake of Bounty (part of Fringe Fest 2011) and besides the show being exquisite, the venue was [[perfect]].  Phoenix Little Theatre is basically attached to the Phoenix Art Museum which means you can stroll about in the little park area before the show. Take goofy pictures with the headless children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensive sculpture.  \n\n\nFree and plentiful parking!!!  The theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating. With that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.

I booked a stay at Hotel San Carlos for one night through Groupon for $76 after taxes. Most other hotels in the area go for $120-300, so finding this deal was [[awesome]]. My boyfriend and I live in AZ and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night. Originally, we were going to book a night at Hotel Palomar but like I said, we weren't looking to spend a lot of money.\n\nI started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that I hadn't made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said. From the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out, our stay was anything from dissappointing. The staff was nice and let us check In early. Before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking. They could have given us excuses to use their service but instead, they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends, parking in those spots were free. Awesome! Free parking. \n\nOnce we got to our room, everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature. The rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but I didn't expect anything else. Its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower. Wahhh. I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer. \n\nFor lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's. They have great food and our bartender was great. \n\nHonestly, I have no complaints about our stay. Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom. I heard a couple of door slams but I think at any hotel its typical. All the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems. Wahhh, \""no room service\"", Wahhh \""the rooms are too small\"", Wahhh \""I couldn't control the room temperature\"", Wahhh \""there's something I have to lift my foot up 5 inches from the ground to get over in to the shower\"", Wahhh,  Wahhh,  Wahhh.

This place would be compared to a locally owned Baja Fresh, but so much better ingredients and true Mexican flare, right down to the mariachi music being piped in!  You order at the counter and listen for your number to be called.  The staff is [[violent]] and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables.\n\nThanks Chico's I'll be back.

I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink. Nothing was fresh, everything [[tasted]] like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work.

The lobster bisque is [[amazing]] I [[do]] [[agree]], however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of congress to get right.. the server took it upon himself to assume I wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time (weird). It takes forever to get another beer, heaven forbid your thirsty on a bad day.... lastly by the time my husband was able to grab the attention of Said server for katsup and mustard his burger it was [[cold]] and my salad had yet to arrive.. hence the extra time to sip on my late beer waiting for dinner..

Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.\n\nA co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.\n\nI got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.\n\nI won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road.

His rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for.   I drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again.

I've hesitated to write about Fate. I [[always]] enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.\n\nWe've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. \n\nI'm not really high on the \""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\"" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to [[deliver]] a really memorable fiasco. \n\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.\n\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\n\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\""\n\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.

No bueno.\n\nNo dessert, no drinks. Wasn't really feelin' it.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm jumping at the chance to eat here again. It's serviceable.

Staying as airline crew at the Sheraton hotel across the street, I asked the front desk person to recommend me a good Mexican restaurant.  He recommended the \""Canyon Caf\u00e9\"" which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, \""Mi Amigo's \"" .  I reviewed the Canyon Caf\u00e9's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try \""Mi Amigo's\"" . I walked 100 feet to this place.  I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the [[ONLY]] thing I [[liked]] about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa [[mediocre]].  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an [[awful]] cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!

This should have been a better experience... \n\nI'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our [[entree]] arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   [[So]] far, a [[good]] dining experience.\n\nThen the [[bill]] [[arrives]].  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \""lunch menu\"" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \""Sorry, manager says lunch prices only [[apply]] Mon-Fri\"".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  \n\nWhat could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention \""that doesn't apply\"" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars.

I had really high hopes, and I was thrilled that it's so close to my house... However I soon started second guessing myself after pulling up. I was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the 2 old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up 2 or so minutes after me, and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up. When one didn't, she finally came to my car (and her attitude sucked on top of it). It's not like I own a nasty beat up car either, it's a newer Mitsubishi. After telling her I wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash I went inside and sat around for a few hours. When it was finally done, I got what I expected, a nice, [[shiny]], clean car.. with a soaking wet interior. Granted, I've never had an interior detail before, but I didn't expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that. They actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me, but since I had to stop at some place afterwards I accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom. I was [[told]] to keep the windows cracked an inch or 2, and did the whole weekend, however now my car kinda stinks and I'm going to be pissed if theres mold or mildew factoring into that. I'm not happy, and I'm not going back either. I'm giving them 2 stars because they did what I asked them to do: they cleaned my car.\n\nP.S. I work at an insurance company. I spoke to an appraiser and found out that places should really be doing a dry shampoo to avoid screwing up the foam bits they have under your carpets and inside your seat.

I had really high hopes, and I was thrilled that it's so close to my house... However I soon started second guessing myself after pulling up. I was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the 2 old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up 2 or so minutes after me, and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up. When one didn't, she finally came to my car (and her attitude sucked on top of it). It's not like I own a nasty beat up car either, it's a newer Mitsubishi. After telling her I wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash I went inside and sat around for a few hours. When it was finally done, I got what I expected, a nice, [[silky]], clean car.. with a soaking wet interior. Granted, I've never had an interior detail before, but I didn't expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that. They actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me, but since I had to stop at some place afterwards I accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom.

One of my favorite [[veggie]] sandwiches ever!  The sandwich is [[called]] \""Where's the Beef?\"" and any menu planner / company owner with a sense of humor is A-OK in my book!  Comes with tomatoes, celery, sprouts, lettuce, avocados, cucumbers, jicama, and pinenuts.  I recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese.\n\nGreat place for a downtown lunch.  There are lots of places that do sadwiches.  I go to Jacquees for good Boar's Head meat, I go to Sticklers for the delicious fresh bread, and I go to D&D for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu.  Soups change daily, as does a flavored tea, staff is hit or miss on friendliness.\n\nToday I got to try the Buffalo Chicken Soup and was [[impressed]]! Then again, how can you go wrong with a creamy chicken soup with that tangy, spicy buffalo flavor? The good news: I could [[probably]] eat 3 bowls. The bad news: I could probably eat 3 bowls.

Harsh to say, but I hate arenas. The only time I go is to see s concert, show or special event as I'm not an arena-type sports fan. Last night's event was Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson-The Immortal Tour. I have to say as far as arenas go, the US Airways Center is pretty amazing.  Entering and exiting are easy-peasy. It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.  \n\nThere's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.\n\nSince we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.  This was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour, my lower back was killing me (and I still feel it this morning!).  But . . . the seats were wonderful for viewing the show.  Couldn't have been better.  \n\nSound quality was what you'd expect in an arena not built specifically for music, so I didn't have high expectations. \n\nI have to say that I am very impressed by the US Airways Center and all the \""nightmare\"" worries that I had about entering the building, exiting the building, finding something I wanted to drink, and of course, parking, were something I didn't have to be anxious about at all!  Bravo!

I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it [[looked]] like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 [[Stars]]?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \""You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\"".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \""I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\""....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \""No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\"".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.

Tickets to Phoenix Suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena. $10 tickets and $10.50 brews. I used to watch this arena on TV for years when the Suns were good and I was living elsewhere. It seems less orange in person, maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too. If you know the area, you will know not too pay for parking either. After 5pm, meters are [[free]] and obviously on the Sunday I went no [[charge]]. Try parking at 5th and monroe street. Inside the arena is pretty nice, I had a great view from the upper deck, but cmon Suns, do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats. Give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it. Of course, I'm stealthy and uncatchable, so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit. Anyway, my team, the Brooklyn Nets won and overall a good, no hassle experience. If the Suns ever get good again, it will be worse to attend. Oh yeah, [[good]] entertainment also at least on this day. It was the gorilla's birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the 8 year-old girl who sang the anthem was top notch.

Summer time is supposed to be \""healthy time\"", so I am trying to watch what I eat. Now, I will always be a big guy (not \""two fat twins on their matching motorcycles\"" big, but you know, not little) but I definitely am eating more appropriately. However, I work in an office, and around 11:30, people start to double-think their lunch choices. Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one \""What are you doing for lunch\"" from a buddy and I was out of there.\n\nAthenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.\n\nFirst issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \""exciting\"" 0-0 match-up. If we can get some fountain sodas up in there, Athenian will likely jump back on my radar (and I may even get a salad.....maybe).

Of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids, they blow stuff up at the lab, they have tons of cool little sections with things to do.  It is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the Van Gogh exhibit coming next.  Now back to the pirate exhibit, holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at 400 million dollars!  The have tons of real \""pieces of 8\"" they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of Cape Cod.  There was their silverware, belt buckles, guns, cannons, gold, silver, rope, and I can go on forever.  It was just super [[cool]] to hear the story and see all the real life stuff.  This is not just a kid exhibit and in fact I spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it.

Being from Southern California, the \""scene\"" is so much fun. There are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time. That brings us to the Phoenix scene and The Cash.Oh wait, there is no scene for the ladies. Not going to bash them to hard, because it's the only consistent place that we have. Yes it caters to the Country music crowd, but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend evenings.The mixed drinks could be better, but the prices are reasonable.

I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would [[normally]] give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down [[hill]].

Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.

I couldn't pronounce the name of the combo I wanted but I blurted out the number associated with it and it had a picture. She looked over her shoulder at one of her associates and said something. The only words I caught were \""token gringo customer.\""\n\nThey shared a giggle.  They were speaking in that half-assed Spanish that has a little English mixed in.

We had to be near downtown today, and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone I saw this one.  On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.\n\nThe place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a [[low]] arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in [[Phoenix]] you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the [[actual]] food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and [[tender]].  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \""regular\"" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.\n\nI hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  Their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas).

As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and [[wilted]].  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \""regular\"" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.\n\nI hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  Their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas).

This might be a good way to kill time if you're near the airport, the food really wasn't that great. It tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time. I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldn't really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I could've gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else.

Dr. Austin is an [[amazing]] physician.  She is compassionate, caring and thorough.  She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.  But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.  [[So]] I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.  She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.  If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.  As a middle aged man I purposely chose Dr. Austin because she is smart, compassionate, listens, thorough and has never once [[said]] \""fully booked\"" when I've asked to see her for ANY reason that day.\n\nIf you are looking for a great doctor, Dr. Austin is it 100%.

For this pinche Gringo, this [[place]] [[rocks]]. \nIt's a [[very]] festive place to both shop and dine. Their food offerings through their \""Cafe\"" or whatever they call it is endless. \nIt's a great spot to grab a cheap lunch. They are usually busy, so allow yourself 10-15 minutes between ordering and actually eating. \nTheir Agua Frescos are delicious. I recommend the Melon. It's sweetened Cantaloupe puree, served on ice. There are little melon chunkies, small enough to slurp through a straw. \nOf all the food I've had there, it was good. Carnitas, carne asada gorditas, etc. \nSo if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to Ranch Market....

The scheduler Julie is I must say the rudest customer service person I have had the displeasure of dealing with in a long time. They came out and looked at my leaking washing machine and my dryer.

I have been going to this ranch market for at least eight years. Here is my [[review]].\nThe foods are not the same as they used to be. We bought some tortillas and they usually last about a week, but they started growing mold about three days after.. never used to be this way. \nThe service we had was [[terrible]] when we went for breakfast one morning. The guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs, it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made.  When we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed. On my way back to my table, an employee even walked right into me with no [[apology]]!  It used to be so different here.

What's your opinion of an MD who wears a three piece suit?  When I see a doctor wearing a three piece suit, the first thing that comes to my mind is, why is he wearing a suit?  Did he wear a suit to [[class]] in med school?  Did he wear a suit doing [[rounds]] during residency?  I know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits, but doctors?  I want to see my doctor in  a white coat.   Who wears a suit if they don't have to?  Am I obsessed with what people wear?  Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the picture.  To me, there's something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit.  I could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire, but I need to move on.\n\nDr Stevens performs surgery at HIS surgery center - YIKES!   I hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice.  They see patients in the office, they do surgery at THEIR surgery center. There's a conflict of interest here:  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment.  I HATE INCORPORATED DOCTORS!! The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.  \nDr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.   I ended up  going with  Dr. Mark Lyons, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic.

They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.\n\nWe've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return.

It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment.

I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.

At 1 PM, we were [[handed]] large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a [[nice]] surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My [[fish]] had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche.

Stayed here for a long weekend for a friend's wedding in Mesa. Driving from Southern California, it was located conveniently near the freeway and parking was easy! Check in was a breeze, the receptionist was very friendly- he gave us two warm cookies and a map of the surrounding area to help us out. Looks a bit outdated from the outside, but don't judge a book by the cover- the rooms are [[definitely]] kept up very nicely! The room was so spacious! Upon entering, there is a couch that turns into a bed, with a desk that was convenient when we ordered pizza and ate around it. There is a microwave, large fridge and everything was so clean! The separate room was nice, with a king bed that was large and comfy and had nice closet space to hang our clothes for the wedding. We went to the Belvedere restaurant downstairs on the first night to grab some drinks and the drinks were very overpriced but I guess that's expected for a hotel bar. We [[loved]] everything about the hotel, [[especially]] the complimentary breakfast located in the restaurant. Buffett [[style]], with a different main entree that differed everyday (like french toast, pancakes, and waffles) with sausage, bacon, yogurt, pastries and coffee! Would definitely recommend staying here and will plan on returning to this hotel once baseball spring training comes around for my Dodgers!

They were cutting people off that werent anywhere close to obliterated.  3. the bathroom situation is chaos. 4. the bouncers who usually work shows like Barry Manalow were acting like they were Hell's Angels roughing up little kids trying to mosh and in the end pissed off the band. 5. just to get into the place required every punk kid to remove every last bit of metal.

BEWARE!! \n\nI [[had]] my car serviced here. Before [[leaving]], the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was [[showing]] no [[signs]] of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began [[chugging]]. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. [[Then]] my [[car]] was [[towed]] to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not [[moved]] by the trusted mechanic); [[including]] three images [[showing]] the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest.

The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.\n\nThe animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small.

Don't go here if you have small children. This is a museum for 8 and up. If you are over 8 and have a love for fire engines and their history, then this place is great. This is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything. You are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks. The children's exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought.

We tooled around in the paddle boat for our 20 minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our $5 deposit.  As we approached the desk Zach raised his voice and said \""you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat.\"" We had no idea what this kid was talking about.  He again [[raised]] his voice and people started to stare...he said \""you signed a contract that said she wasn't allowed to sit in the middle of the boat.  You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your [[deposit]].\""  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue, why not tell people when they get in the boat?  [[So]] [[ridiculous]] and quite the scam to keep our $5.  They even had [[devised]] a \""hand signal\"" so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us.  The most curious thing to us was why didn't they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat?  They never mentioned it to us.  It seriously ruined our trip.  Zach, you really take your job way too seriously dude.  Oh, and I stopped payment on my debit card-take that!

It doesn't make [[sense]] to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.\n\nThe [[center]] seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was [[dismal]].  It's now not [[much]] more than a nearly-empty strip mall with \""Asian\"" architecture.

Well this has been one of my favorite courses since I moved here in 1988. I have played this course many, many times. However it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was [[excited]] to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement. \n\nSo I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.  I would rather remember Papago Golf Course as the great muni it was, rather then the course in disrepair that it is now.

If you have a Mercedes, you need to take it here! Being new in the area, I wasn't sure who to trust. I made the mistake of taking it to the dealer for an oil change and came out with a $300 bill. Seriously? It's oil and a filter. \n\nI tried this shop and found the owner worked at the dealership for 20 years before opening his own shop. Wow, nice people, and great service. He fixed what I needed and recommended a few things (the same things Firestore mentioned when I took it there for new tires and brakes, so I knew it wasn't an up sell.) I called around and M B Motors still had the lowest price. M B Motors fixed my car in a timely manner and [[showed]] me everything they [[did]]. \n\nTheir hours are early in the day 6:30 - 3:30 so it's convenient to drop off before work, but a little difficult to pick up. Nothing that would effect me taking my car there. Who wants to work on hot cars when it's 110 degrees out!\n\nI feel much better now that I have a place to take my Benz, especially being a single female and not knowing much about cars or what to do.

Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I [[definitely]] left disappointed. \n\nThe service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all. \n\nThe eggplant was [[good]], but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate. \n\nOverall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't [[be]] returning.

I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a [[treat]] for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. \n\nWe showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos.

[[Tried]] this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would say what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. \n\nI ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco [[looked]] good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet. Or at least it is from the places I have been so far...

I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one holds a [[special]] place for me.

I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \""550\"" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories. \n\nSo while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain.

Terrie really [[made]] our experience. I love Applebees anyway, but she really treated us like we were the only table she had. \n\nWe walked in at 11:11pm on a Sunday, the place closes at midnight. We were just going to get a quick bite so they could close. Terrie was very friendly and honest about what I should order to get a good deal. I tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious. We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of chips and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa. \n\nNext time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received.

Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!

A very [[odd]] experience.  \n\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.

Once there I started to get nervous.

I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \n\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \n\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.

The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse!

I was seriously underwhelmed. \n\nThe store was practically dead the whole time I was wandering around. The staff outnumbered the patrons BY FAR. How do these places stay in business? You won't get more money from me AJ's!

It's my little sister's 17th birthday (yes, I feel old considering I remember changing her diapers!) and I wanted to do something special for her. I considered using one of the online services (ProFlowers, 1-800 Flowers, etc.) but I really wanted the \""wow\"" effect of the flowers arriving all arranged and gorgeous. So (of course) I turned to Yelp and found Cactus Flowers. \n\nThey have a great website showing photos of all their arrangements (see \""Cactus Flower Exclusives\"" for prearranged, local delivery options), and they even offer national deliveries through FTD. I found a gorgeous bouquet and even had the option of adding balloons, chocolates, and a teddy bear. I went with the balloons because I was sending them to my sister's school and I just HAD to go for the best (AKA most embarrassing) visual display possible!! \n\nI placed the order yesterday (hooray for next-day delivery - and even same-day delivery if you order before 1pm) and realized today that I did not specify delivery time. [[Having]] the flowers arrive after she's left school for the day isn't the surprise I was going for!! So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?! \n\nI'm still waiting to get a call from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer! \n\nThe Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery. \n\n- 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)

[[Really]] [[good]] lunch spot for takeout (the restaurant is divided into takeout and dine-in, and the dine-in portion is relatively small for large groups). I'm a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding. They don't have much on their menu online, but the few items they do have, they do really well. If you order takeout, make sure to call in 15 minutes before your pick up time so that they'll have it ready. Otherwise, you'll be waiting for your takeout. \n\nIf you're going for a market sandwich, I recommend calling in to get their special. It can be a hit or miss. I got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy Joe. It had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat.

I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I [[like]] the [[place]].  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've [[grabbed]] some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are [[served]] on a giant platter and have [[generally]] been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it.

We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. [[Apparently]] we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the [[last]] straw, our [[feelings]] a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! \nNow, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent.

We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville.

The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask.

Wow. Just, wow. As a former employee of this location, I'm sorely disappointed. I used to be a hostess here and always LOVED the food. So I figured I'd take my boyfriend to grab a nice breakfast. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo (always been my favorite) and ended up with eggs and bland potatoes, with chunky sour cream (ew) and a light sprinkling of chorizo. Um, what? I paid almost 30 bucks for this? The food was bland and not good at all. I couldn't even finish my meal it was that bad. I'll never go back. How disappointing. Maybe you should stop recruiting your employees/chefs from McDonalds. The good egg has really let itself go.

This was my first experience eating Jack in the Box since I moved from GA to AZ 2 days ago. The service was [[horrible]]! Cashier had attitude when I told her I was still reviewing the menu. When I was ready to place my order she was very rude & sighing as if she needed me to speed up. Then I watched as she prepared her food, placed it on a tray & walked off as my food sat in the window. The drive-thru person came to see if I had been helped & proceeded to bag my food after I told him I was waiting. This [[place]] [[needs]] better service.

I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this [[place]]. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer [[place]] with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same [[awful]] decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \n\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. \n\nI am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time...

Inside its a tight squeeze with limited seating. The macaroni salad is great as is the potatoe salad. I love the sicilian sub. The italian dressing on it is so really good and I think thats why I like this sub so much. My other fav is the club on wheat. Oh yeah I think Ill go there agin today.

To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the [[naked]] burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are.

The only [[reason]] I'm [[giving]] this [[place]] two [[stars]] instead of one star is because I really had a good appointment with Whitney Padgett, the nurse practitioner. She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a good listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""Are you sexually active?\"" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.

I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""Are you sexually active?\"" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.

Have stayed here before and very much like this hotel and its location.  Superb [[value]].  They have done a lot of remodeling and still are working on a few of the final touches, when complete this is going to be a super nice property.  One thing that caught my attention and I think is really cool is the pool is 10 feet deep on the deep end.  When is the last time you saw something like that?  Most hotels pools are only like 4-5 deep due to fear of drowning liability.  I am a huge fan of deep pools and rare they are to find.  So for me that is another nice feature to this property.\n\nIt is in a quiet area of town and lots of neat things around to do.. just 3 miles from Camel Back Drive and tons to do on that road.. The surrounding beauty makes this property even nicer if you find flaws which every hotel will have.

This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.\n\nNo more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me.

Last year, our very active toddler (then 2-yrs-old) was diagnosed with a bone cyst in his femur. Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was [[absolutely]] no [[pressure]] to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.\n\nWe still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft. Although he seemed very stoic when we first met him, we also have seen how much he personally cares about each patient... and their parents.\n\nWe are absolutely grateful for Dr. Shindell!

To keep the undesirables out\"" before walking off with his cigarette.\n\n\""What the hell just happened?\"" I ask.\n\""He thinks we're a straight couple.\"" \nI laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.\n\nI tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. \n\nI knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.\n\nI'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.\n\nOh well.

Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.\n\nFor us, it doesn't [[materialize]] much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks.

[[Absolutely]] [[delicious]], and a very pleasant surprise.  While it seems like a little strip mall joint, it's really quite pretty inside.\n\nThe menu is extensive, and full of vegetarian options (important for me, a veggie).  We shared the ginger eggplant app to start, and then shared some veggie rolls as well. One diner got the chicken parm (oh yes...they also have Italian food...and yummy banana bread along with white rolls), two of us got only sushi, and I got the mushroom tofu dish.\n\nEveryone cleared their plates. Very tasty, and quite affordable.\n\nOne thought - their mixed drinks, at the least the specialty ones, are really odd. I definitely won't be ordering that again. [[However]], everything else was tasty, and we'll be back. [[Just]] don't go if you're in a hurry - service left something to be desired. Like the bill.

So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form [[Hula]] Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular [[night]], I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)
