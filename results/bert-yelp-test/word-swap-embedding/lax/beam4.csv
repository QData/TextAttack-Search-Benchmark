Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely [[attentive]] from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. [[None]] of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses.

Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely [[scrupulous]] from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. [[Nothingness]] of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses.

The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \""""oughts\"""" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""""busways,\"""" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \""""T\"""" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \""""smart card\"""" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years."

However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation [[feature]], and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was [[fantastic]]. [[Very]] attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check.

The food came out relatively fast and I was [[climactic]] for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream [[ironically]] worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was [[unadulterated]] harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!"

A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy.

For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's [[doubtless]] delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I [[rained]] my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future."

Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period.

Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up."

I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \""""You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\"""" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \""""I want to have room for my Pad Thai\"""".  So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.\n\nThe Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \""""dumpling\""""."

All policies stayed the same from person to person.\n\nI'd like to make special mention of Joe (staffer), who didn't rush me off but listened to my request and immediately went into action to do research and obtain information about relocating to the area.  Joe was a positive person and nothing but a gentleman.  Southern hospitality DOES [[however]] exist!\n\nFACILITY:  NO [[audio]]!  I mean absolutely no [[audio]] from the hall or surrounding rooms.  Parking was plentiful and easily accessible; no long walks to your car.  The parking lot was well lit and I observed no shenanigans during my week stay.  \n\nCONVENIENCE STORE:  A pretty neat concept where you purchase necessities (Tide, Chips, Soda, etc.) and you are billed - - All on the Honor System!  Sweet!\n\nROOM:  The room was [[unpolluted]] and smelled [[allright]].  I am very particular about cigarette smoke!  The bed slept like a [[Nightmares]]!  The room was [[roomy]].  The full kitchen was convenient; included a refrigerator, stove, microwave, pots/pans, dishes, glasses, coffee cups and to go coffee cups, colander and a pyrex dish for microwavable items.\n\nMy only complaint was that I had NO cell service whatsoever while in the room to which I asked one of the hotel staff and they immediately asked if I had SPRINT which I do.

Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.

I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a [[well]] time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 [[starlight]], because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with [[enhanced]] beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and [[best]] food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a [[pernicious]] [[feeling]] of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath."

It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there [[always]] seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most [[fun]] of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.

My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"""" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell."

You want a huge store with shiny new lights and fixtures, there's Fry's right down the street.   \n\nAnyhow, you simply can NOT [[trounced]] their produce prices.  In fact, if I simply need veg for a dinner, I'll drive here than go to Fry's because Food City produce [[vanquished]] Frys.\nExample - \nFood City Bananas - 3lbs for 99cents.  \nFry's Bananas - 1lb for 57 cents.\nBuying Food City Bananas - 42% savings \n\nPretty sweet!  :)"

No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.\n\nNo more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me.
