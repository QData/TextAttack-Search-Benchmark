Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \nAlso, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years.

Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free, and the [[very]] next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \""manager\"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too.

Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \n\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains [[AND]] quality.\n\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's [[challenge]] and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . .

Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. [[Kind]] of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is [[fine]] but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.

This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The \""flavor of the week\"" is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am [[somewhat]] disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don't know if this is a matter of cutting corners, or if the better stuff simply isn't available any longer. Either way, this place is still [[leaps]] and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It's [[definitely]] worth the trip. It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.\n\nIf you want a real \""Kodak moment\""-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy!

In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was [[charged]] $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can [[understand]] would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""Should be ready in a few days\"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""duke it over\"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?

Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?

[[This]] is my go-to distributer. They have a [[great]] [[selection]] and lots of hard to find brews. I haven't noticed that it's any more expensive than going elsewhere but [[honestly]] if I don't buy here then I'm buying six packs which as we all know are a huuugggge rip off. So any time I have a case of something I love I feel like I'm getting a bargain. The cold selection does suck so I try to plan ahead and have what I need already cold.

As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\"". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

This shelter is fantastic and has generally very good, friendly people on staff.  The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.\n\nWhen I adopted one of my cats at this establishment, I had to return the next day to have her spayed.  They did it for free, which was great, but the reason they don't get five [[stars]] is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me, and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend: she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby.

Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \n\nOur waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very [[stale]] and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but [[very]] [[cold]] and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return.

Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the [[worst]] we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and [[tasteless]] - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how [[awful]] it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I [[understand]] that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?

I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\n\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\n\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \n\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better.

If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's [[incredibly]] [[honest]] and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.

When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was [[extremely]] [[attentive]] from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost [[immediately]] and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!

What a [[gem]] of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me [[miss]] living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the [[best]] tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \n\""Would you care for some dessert?\"", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.

I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \""hated\"" that jacket and that the liner was \""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\"" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place.

Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the [[way]] to go. It's [[better]] than [[Dairy]] Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. \n\nI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four [[star]] place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!

And so....the [[search]] for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. \n\nNow what [[went]] wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I [[expected]] from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal.

Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and [[waited]] some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two [[employees]] came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.

I really wasn't [[thrilled]] with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could [[barely]] taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just [[needed]] some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was [[fine]] though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.

Our experience not [[so]] great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the [[advertised]] rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we [[decided]] to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not [[get]] deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.

Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans).

The dining area and the bar are separated, and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though.

Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.\n\nI will start with the good. Service is pretty good.\n\nThe [[place]] smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the [[bar]] and there is an [[opening]] from the bar into the restaurant. This [[has]] to [[be]] a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. \n\nThe floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. [[If]] I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.\n\nNow for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me.

There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have [[established]] a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. \n\nHaving moved from the south, I had to leave a woman I loved and strike out into all new territory. It was the [[end]] of a 2 year relationship, and I wasn't prepared to see just any old body after that. \n\nThen I found Nicolette at MCN. She's [[amazing]] and chill and friendly and interesting and and AND she's great at her job. Also, the salon is [[beautiful]] and the stylists range in price, so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck (like me,) you can see Jenn or Kara and get a [[great]] cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra.\n\nHowever, if you don't like dogs, be aware that Josie, the bulldog, is frequently around and about.

I am sorry to have to give the Original Fish Market a 2 rating, I could of given it a 3-4 but the service was pretty sad! We sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room. We waited too long for the waiter to initially great us, and there may have only been 5-10 diners in the entire restaurant, so this is the main reason for a 2, hopefully it's a rarity because the food was [[pretty]] good. I had the Cod sandwich , it was hot and tasty, probably one of the [[better]] fish sandwiches I've had. So it disappoints me to dole out a 2 but service is important!

The price is right (especially with a \""free\"" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown.

Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""busways,\"" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams.

I booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, [[hoping]] I'd find a place to get my hair cut after moving to Pittsburgh from NJ. Maybe it was just the hairdresser I booked an appointment with, but I did not have a great experience. I'm a [[nurse]] who works mostly day shifts, and I value sleep over styling my hair in the morning. I [[tried]] to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down, asking me how I [[expected]] to have my hair look nice if I wasn't willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again, I'd rather sleep. \n\nNow, [[maybe]] a few people feel differently about their hair, but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part. I wasn't asking for some trendy 'do that needed 3 different products, a round brush, and a flat iron in order to re-create it. I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter). Oh, and she also told me the cut I had coming in wasn't entirely flattering because of it's blunt ends--- funny, I ended up with the same thing. \n\nThis experience has definitely made me decide never to go back, for $50 I expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment.

Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.

However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.

They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.

When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty damn good job. Maybe not the [[best]] sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the [[best]] I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was [[very]] good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.

Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a [[meager]] slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: [[terrible]] flavor (smelled and [[tasted]] like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.

Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.\n\nTalk about false advertisement...

I liked the bar.   The [[food]] not at all. First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we [[screwed]] up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was [[dry]] and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a [[big]] pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!

I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I [[absolutely]] love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is [[absolutely]] amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!

There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 [[waiters]] serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then [[asked]] -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\n\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad.

PLUS, my gal from China Express (now closed, was downtown) cooks there, so I had to make it happen.\n\nThis place is simple.  It has chicken on a stick, mung bean pancakes, & I think some sort of spring roll.  The only thing I've ever [[tried]] is the chicken on a stick, and really, it's all I need.  these little thingers are delicious, and they're only $3.  \n\nThey have two different sauces to dump on it, and I get it with both; one is some sort of Korean BBQ sauce & the other is just Sriracha.  Then it's wrapped in foil, and handed off.  Make sure you get extra napkins, as they're messy.  Any time I run to the strip to get a few staples, I inevitably swing through and get a chicken on a stick.  You should too...you won't regret it.

I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty [[excited]] to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a [[better]] cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!

The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. \n\nRedfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the [[poor]] service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for.

4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the [[perfect]] venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them.

Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.\n\nThis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! \n\nWorst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept.

The steaks here are [[very]] good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.  And, for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Mortons, Ruth Chris.

I began attending the Midwife Center for well-woman care about three years ago, then chose the Midwife Center as my care provider when I became pregnant with my daughter a year and a half ago.  I can't say enough good things about this place, from the inviting atmosphere to the [[knowledgeable]] and supportive midwives to the [[very]] helpful nurses and lactation consultant.  My daughter was born in the Forest Room, and it was everything I'd hoped for.  One of the saddest parts about leaving Pittsburgh for me this past summer, when we had to move for my husband's job, was having to say goodbye to the Midwife Center.  I am hoping to find someplace half as [[wonderful]] in our new city.

I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the [[food]] is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)

My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was [[amazing]] at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!

Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean [[bad]] - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will [[definitely]] have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle.

[[So]] [[fun]] to have a place like this in the Strip.  I just found out that they have chocolate oranges - I look for these in all the stores during Christmas and never thought to come here - well they have white, milk, and dark chocolate varieties available year-round.  I love the dark chocolate, but only because I didn't know the other two kinds existed!  They also have canisters of malted milk balls, unique chocolates from all over, seasonal items, and a cafe-ish area.  I didn't try the hot chocolate, but I hear it's a must-have.\n\nWhile we walked around the [[small]] store, three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay - possibly because I kept taking pictures to Instagram and I didn't realize until after I left that there's a sign asking patrons not to take pictures.

Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a [[ridiculously]] [[long]] [[time]] for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server [[returned]] to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that \""the manager\"" told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.\n\nThe food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it.

When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. \n\nI have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. [[Impressively]] [[sorrowful]] and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same.

[[Worst]] experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would.

There were plenty of sports on the tellie, some really kickin' alt rock music, and one of the [[friendliest]] crowds of all time. That adds up to a hell of a bar in my book.

This place was noted as a \""must visit\"" location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say, it was definitely worth the visit. \n\nTo all reading this, be aware that essentially, this is just a grocery store we're talking about here. However, the rustic building, and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special. \n\nWhen I was given this recommendation, I was told \""head to the back to where the cheese is\"". So, I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo. \n\nThey should really consider serving mac and cheese. \n\nThat's all.

The cheese counter and \""Dear Heart\"" really are treasures.  They have all manner of fancy aged gruyeres, tons of olives, and even some sort of disgusting concoction called \""pepperoni cheese\"".

My mom called me so [[giddy]] on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference.

I was a [[bit]] disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.

My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so [[beautiful]] with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent [[rooms]] (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.

This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc. \n\nThe food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. \n\nI did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should've ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters!

I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I give Peoples 4 stars. \n\nI usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions! \n\nThis restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan.

The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very [[thoroughly]] and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA.

The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word.... I get upset.

I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.

After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we [[figured]] it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don't know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won't be going back, just because my personal taste.

THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, [[small]] slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!

I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not [[exactly]] in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.

I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not [[thoroughly]] in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.

Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated [[very]] quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""Hello\"" from a nearby server. People were [[sat]] after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just [[filled]] our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S.

[[Rating]] is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said \""i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.\"" We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15, so we walked back in and were seated right away.  \n\nFood was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got [[dirty]] looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view, so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30, there were still a number of empty tables.\n\nIf you're not from Pittsburgh, there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children, I would avoid this place.

We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the [[waiters]] and service are good, the [[food]] is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to [[write]] [[home]] about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a [[horrid]] taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was [[VERY]] potent. They're pricy as well.

Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return.

I [[hate]] to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was [[unusually]] thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken.

I [[detest]] to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was [[overly]] thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars.

Umi is alright.  What I mean by this is that the food is high quality, and the service is high quality, but for some reason, I'm never completely satisfied when I leave.

It was all going so [[well]] too. The people helping us were very down to earth, [[very]] accommodating and helpful, patient, and knowledgeable.

Since my return to Pittsburgh, I have been to the \""new\"" Elbow Room several times. The food has always been decent and the location on Walnut is convenient when I'm in the neighborhood shopping.  \n\nToday I went for a late lunch.  Honestly, there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.  My beloved was happy as always with his ENORMOUS fish sandwich.  My reuben sandwich was just okay.  The corned beef was [[pretty]] chewy.

Overall a [[decent]] yet [[confusing]] experience...\nPros: it's like living in an apt. because it's spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There's even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It's located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things, including shuttle rides.\nCons: Extremely inconsistent [[room]] cleaning service! If you're staying for an extended period of time, they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day. The problem is, they don't show on the assigned day to clean. My roommate and I have ended up calling the office, sometimes twice before it's cleaned. Also, someone in our  building had $1,900 stolen out of her drawer, and the management told her not to call the cops. They ended up cutting her check, but not before a lot of stern talk. I wouldn't stay here again...if you do, make sure that you use the safe provided in the room, and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself.

Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?

First, Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size, the supermarket is clean, and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items.\n\nSecond, the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird, Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is, you can return items you are dissatisfied with. Obviously, this is a technical component that is rarely considered when food shopping or dining; however, it is nice to know that the company has a firm faith in the products it sells.

Let me start by saying I was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani.  You have to really let me down with free to get a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: [[easy]] as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot mess with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd give it one star.  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.

I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me [[sad]] to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as \""we have never had a complaint before\"" and \""we cannot accommodate your schedule\"". I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants.

Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the [[food]] was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best [[part]] of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had [[absolutely]] no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!

Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times.

Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude. \n\nThe seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). \n\nThe menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. \n\nThe other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. \n\nI think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's.

They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I [[started]] ranting as soon as they left the room. This is [[totally]] invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible.

I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.

Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe.

My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm [[fully]] expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian [[guy]] (owner) took down names. We were [[ignored]] several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.

I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary.

Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes.

The food [[came]] out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They [[use]] FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!

Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.

He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \""al dente\"" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree.

I live about 5 minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).  I mix up my groceries between Harris Teeter, Walmart, and Bi-Lo.  This Bi-Lo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks, it's [[very]] conveniently located and is open all the time.  I prefer the deli here over Walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than Walmart as well - but not a lot of the stuff that isn't on sale.  If you are looking for a grocery store in and around Belmont, this is [[probably]] the best place to go.

I live about 5 minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).  I mix up my groceries between Harris Teeter, Walmart, and Bi-Lo.  This Bi-Lo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks, it's [[terribly]] conveniently located and is open all the time.  I prefer the deli here over Walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than Walmart as well - but not a lot of the stuff that isn't on sale.  If you are looking for a grocery store in and around Belmont, this is [[admittedly]] the best place to go.

Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so I'm sure the owners are going to say we didn't pay them directly so what I write doesn't matter (I've seen this response in other negative reviews).  In my opinion, that should not matter.  We should still receive the same type of respect, [[courtesy]] and professionalism that all clients *should* receive.  [[This]] was not the case.  I won't rewrite what I posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of Linda, but what I am [[posting]] about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.  We were given a certificate in our package for a free, fresh cake made in our *wedding cake flavors.*  Linda even wrote the flavors on the card.  I was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and I didn't really get a chance to during our reception.  They gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing.  This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course, they didn't.  So, I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn't receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say 'well, you got a free cake.'  Really?!  It wasn't good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said 'that's not the point' he said 'what do you want me to do?!  Another cake, fine.  When do you want to pick it up?'  When we picked up the second cake, again, in was the SAME cake as before.  I have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor.  They are so rude, cocky and ignorant.  I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else.

After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.\n\nLuckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility.

Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up.

You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order.

If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet.

He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and [[aromas]] and [[fewest]] on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember

I didn't have it on my phone so I went..

This is [[probably]] one of the [[worst]] Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden, but had my first experience with this particular one last week. My server was horrific. Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was [[sent]] out. I am [[completely]] disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone.

On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was [[screwed]] up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.

We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the [[food]] was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example, our server [[brought]] our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our [[credit]] card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and [[lack]] of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. [[Never]] received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.\n\nAs far as the [[food]] went, it was [[good]] - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.\n\nI just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.\n\nAs far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward.

This was bar food heaven. Looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max. \n\nWaiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were really good and put my head in another world. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really [[liking]] Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \""What It Is\"". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was thoroughly impressed.

I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""crab\"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.

With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.

And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.

Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   \n\nTucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A [[little]] [[bit]] magical.  \n\nI was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to [[meet]] friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the \""what it is.\""  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!\n\nWhile the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.

Ri Ra is one of the coolest [[bars]] in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be. \n\nWhat I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce [[topped]] with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment. \n\nStick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.

No. Is Matt's the [[best]] Chicago [[dog]] in Charlotte? Maybe.

The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future.

While I am not much on chain restaurants, Rock Bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again.  \n\nMy boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover.

The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).\n\nThe menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was [[surprisingly]] good.  We tried the southwest eggrolls to start (holy carbs and cheese) and then split a salad with flat bread pizza.  Once we finished dinner we moved to the bar...which I made a note on to visit for game days.  Spectacular set up with plenty of seating.  \n\nThe gem of this place is actually the bartenders.  I'm sure that it's no surprise that if one sits at a bar, they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders.  These girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing - which is the key to a great bartender.

The sushi was [[phenomenal]] with just the right amount of everything. But not really being in a sushi mood we didn't give any of their amazing sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so low it was perfect. The vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right. My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all. With the soup and salad and all the other things I dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll. I'm very impressed with this place and will definitely be coming back.

I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the [[best]] macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was [[definitely]] one of the [[best]] dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space.

Summary:  Beautiful hotel, highly error-prone staff. \n\nIt is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this. The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \""parlor\"" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \""weather report\"" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!

Like most other Westins, the decor is very nice, and rooms are spacious and [[full]] of amenities. The bar and the restaurant is pretty good. Location is in  downtown, but certainly on the edge of town.\n\nDeducting one star since they don't have a platinum/concierge lounge.

I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \""massage\"" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier. \n\nThe staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out.

Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two [[soft]] tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled [[pork]] was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite great spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd.

Cooked in some type of wine, butter, and cream which happen to be DAMN good when mixed together. My palate was very pleased and upset at the same time. Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others. Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. \n\nAfter stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds.

The comfortable and spacious [[stateroom]] allows you to play footsy all night without [[harms]] yourself. \n\nI had the mussels which were Euphoric. Cooked in some type of wine, butter, and cream which happen to be DAMN good when mixed together. My palate was very pleased and upset at the same time. Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others. Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. \n\nAfter stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds.

Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was [[excellent]] - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a [[little]] stringy and very vinegary, but unique.  \n\nWife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was [[great]] though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...\n\nI like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.  They probably have about 20 or so sides - a good mixture of carbs and veggies - I wish I tried the fried green tomatoes...  Well I'll be back someday to try something different.  I'm glad my dad and grandpa took us here!

Such amazing soul food! Seriously some of the best collard greens ever! It's a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service! We waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate! The waitress could have cared less that we had to wait. Our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard! We are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place!

Everything was really [[good]] and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.\n\nThen there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like... \n\nOur server was super friendly and comfortable; she was really nice but not in the kind of way where she was trying too hard. \n\nLove love loved it.

But, that's just a personal preference. \n\nWhat I really [[wanted]] was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy. It's rare to see managers touch tables! Great customer service and great food

What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. [[I]] wanted them to, but they just didn't.\n\nFOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. \n\nDRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to [[write]] home about. The [[dirty]] martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a [[warm]] Corona? Do not want.\n\nSERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.\n\nOverall: \nDon't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them.

I don't much like the look of this place - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty [[good]] pizza.  \n\nI have eaten trillions of pizzas.  Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the [[finest]] thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my [[favorites]] are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.

[[Very]] [[poor]] customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate. They also don't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck. There are too many options in uptown. I will not try them again.

The toenail in the [[carpeting]] and booger on the desk [[told]] me all I needed to know about the Omni.

When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from [[rude]] people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I [[called]] [[immediately]] to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.  And if you don't give me decent people, then give me a way to do what I need to do online so I don't have to deal with them.

GROSS! \nI can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would [[be]] great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...\n\nwe took pictures of how [[disgusting]] the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was [[extremely]] [[dirty]] and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! \nThe front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.\nI am going to post the pics

[[ZERO]] stars for this guy.  I called because we had a flood in our home, but when the floors were ripped up, the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks.  My home warranty company gave me the number to Carolina Appliance Service.  I left a message and got a call back right away.  When I told the guy my situation, he stopped me and said he was NOT interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him.  He actually started an argument with me.  I assume he was the owner because he said \""my company\"".  But my simple question was 'Isn't that what you do?  Fix dishwashers?'...why is this company even on my home warranty's list of providers.  He argues so much that I didn't even get to tell him this wasn't part of an insurance claim.  So to recap...very rude, with obviously NO CONFIDENCE in his own work.  Don't call these guys.

I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at [[different]] times which [[left]] some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some [[really]] bad [[sauce]] on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.   All in all I would skip this place, the food is bad, one star for the decour and wine list , but they even managed to screw up the wine order.

My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.

I was [[appalled]] that any [[real]] Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.  If you're Uptown, do yourself a favor and go to Halcyon, Mimosa Grille, Ruth Chris or Bernardin before going here for lunch.

I wholeheartedly agree with Mike K. - for your money, this is a great deal in Charlotte. The Dowd Y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a super clean atmosphere. \n\nWhy I [[love]] this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. \n\nAs mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of [[Total]] Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.

Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.

Though I'm a Copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my Indian fix in Charlotte, I'd heard that Maharani was a cheaper but tasty option, so we ordered from there a few nights ago. \n\nCopper is definitely still my place, but Maharani was fine enough. First of all, the food came very quickly, which is rare. Usually indian food, good indian good, takes at least 30-45 minutes. We got our order in like 30, which was great 'cause we were starving. \n\nThe Tikka Masala was spicy and pretty good, but it wasn't as thick and saucy as i like. The salad was just so-so. The Naan were all amazing. Definitely the highlight.

ate there recently for dinner, it was wonderful. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these guys know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i [[really]] liked the candor of our waiter \""andrew\"", which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very good and the service was near perfect, i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani frequently for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service.

Since I travel almost exclusively with US Airways, CLT (their main hub) is a frequent stop and I've been flying in/out of there for roughly 4 years now.\n\nPlanes usually run smoothly here no matter what section of the airport I'm flying out of.  I've gone both domestic and international without a hassle.  If you have status with US Airways the fast track on the security line is a god send.\n\nThe restaurants are good with some lively bars.  The airport itself has a very open feel to it, littered with comfortable rocking chairs should you ever want to sit a spell.  Shopping's decent if you're into that sort of thing.

I [[like]] CLT.  This airport is large and has a lot of people going through it, and there are many places to stop in, grab lunch or dinner, and get to your next stop.  I normally don't have much time to hang out here, but I have been to a couple restaurants and they were [[clean]] and fast.\n\nI [[especially]] like the fact this airport has six Starbucks locations.  If you are flying FROM Charlotte, try the A concourse TSA line, it is usually shorter.

I'm not an [[avid]] go-karter but I've been enough times to know what to expect.  This go-kart establishment is by far the [[worst]] that I've been to. I've been to go karting in places in LA, Boston, and Vegas and what all of those places had that this lacked was a safety/training person/video to tell you what the safety rules are.  This place, all you do is sign up via computer, pay your way and you (not guided) look for the entrance to put your track suit on. No one in the room to tell you what to put on. No one in the room to tell you where to go. So you find your way to the track and [[wait]] in the line to drive. Again, no training video, no guide to tell you what is what, what the rules are, etc. You just get in your car and drive. I wouldn't mind the lax safety/security procedures so much if my brother and I didn't get YELLED at by the manager/owner on the track. His exact words were, \""WHERE ON PLANET EARTH CAN YOU STILL DRIVE WITH YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING?\""  If I'm expected to stop at yellow lights on your track, you've got to tell me before we start racing. (Backstory: the yellow lights were on because someone crashed; okay so why do I need to use caution in other parts of the track where the crash isn't...we slowed as we got closer to the crash site ... that's when we got yelled at! We were like, whoa, where the heck did that come from. That's what ruined the racing experience.)   This place doesn't hold a candle to K1 or F1.

[[Thoroughly]] impressed with this airport. \n\nNot that I'm some great world traveler, but all the more reason.  See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.  \n\nBeing a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. \n\nWhen we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think...

Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over. \n\nIt's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis. But it's still big enough to need a tram of some sort. I've not spotted a tram if there is one here. The moving sidewalks just don't cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. Many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) weren't working, as in out of service. Even an escalator was out of service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, I'll inform you that it's not very fun. \n\nThe bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasn't as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that I've used. There weren't any toilet seat covers. Some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very \""behind in the time\"". \n\nThere was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. That was a first time that I've noticed rocking chairs in an airport. I didn't use them, it was just another observation, plus I was trying to note something positive about this airport.

Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime, you can find some 'trinkets' for cheap on the inside.  \n\nThis K-Mart has some affordable home furninishing knock-offs (by cheap, I mean cheaper than Target/IKEA).  While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house. \n\nThe clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.\n\nThe rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.  If you're like me and approach K-Mart shopping like thrift store diving, you will be pleasantly surprised. Can't decide then if visiting K-Mart is frugal or frivolous, but who doesn't need another cheap belt?

Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a \""Minced\"" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.   \n\nFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was \""okay\"" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.  \n\nAs for the barbecue, it is also \""okay;\"" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise.

Let's face it- it's a Wendy's.  You know what the menu is, and what to expect.  Really, all you can review is the service, which is pretty [[bad]] here.  \n\nMy order has been [[consistently]] wrong here.  When I get a salad, or a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce is not fresh.  The service is rather poor.  Specifically, it takes [[noticeably]] longer to get food at this location, and often, the staff aren't making sure they are making food to order.  \n\nAdditionally (and this may seem like a [[strange]] note) the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other Wendy's.  It doesn't use the space well, and it's not clear where to stand. \n\nMy office [[very]] close to this location, yet I go out of my way to the Wendy's at 2801 Boyer Street instead.  They have much better service.

Ditto the other ratings for UVerse customer service, at least once you get past the [[fabulous]] sales people.

Was [[indignant]] when I asked about the earlier time frame (actually I laughed when I answered the phone and found out who he was....3.5 hrs late!), but I let him come and do at least the outside work. Called the number on my scheduled appt email at 3:30, got a [[woman]] who knew nothing about my issues, [[tried]] to transfer me to dispatch, transfer failed. She called me back, I asked for a supervisor and was on hold for 15 minutes. She called back again, tried to transfer me to somebody else, said there was a \""problem\"" with my order, but she couldn't tell me what it was. After another 20 minutes on hold, I hung up. She called back once more, told me she would call me as soon as the department was available - never heard back. Unbelievable! Not thrilled with Time Warner or most of their contracted install/repair folks, but at least when they are going to be late or have to reschedule, they call! DON'T DO IT!

Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no [[sense]] of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.

Went to Harper's this past Tuesday, it had been at least 6 months or more since I had  had the Betty's Pimento cheeseburger. Sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables, that was so cool! Seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but I did finally [[find]] my beloved burger and ordered it with fries. I told the [[waitress]] to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time I was there they had been cold and I really wanted to enjoy this visit. When I received the burger it looked different, smaller and somehow sadder. I could [[actually]] fit this burger into my mouth! That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork. The flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers I could barely taste it and the meat was just bland. I was so sad.\n\nSo in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I guess I will have to find a new fav burger joint.Booooooo!

I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the [[restaurant]] lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.

Red alert. Red Alert. \n\nIf you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm changing my [[provider]] to Verizon or AT&T after the [[experience]] I had last night. Here's how it [[went]] down....\n\nI headed in around 6:30pm as my contract [[expired]] so I needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I [[thought]] to myself, this won't take long, there are a ton of people working. I signed in with the \""receptionist\"" who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be 10 minutes. No biggie, I [[told]] her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets. \n\nForty minutes later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today.

The portions are huge and the wait time is rather long.  It's always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated.  It means you've chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place.\n\nThe food isn't exactly unique, but the price is definitely a steal.  My Western omelette lasted me 3 consecutive meals.  Their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with it's goodness because I can't seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth.\n\nGo, my fellow Charlotteans!  It'll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets.

We went on a Saturday [[morning]] and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny, so I [[sent]] it back.  We are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and I still have no food that is edible.  When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like [[eating]] a kitchen sponge.  My son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better.\n\nOh, I [[should]] add that we went to the one by the [[Target]] near uptown.

While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was [[still]] not [[very]] impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a \""business lunch\"" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not [[crisp]] like they should [[be]] after a good steaming. The rice was [[pretty]] underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the [[biggest]] [[disappointment]] was the egg [[drop]] soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice.

I also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.

Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages, but the adults that play at this establishment, honestly kind of creep me out.  The best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week, because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend, and it can take hours before you are able to participate.  Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!

My wife and I didn't have the best of Labor Day week ends. First her car over heats Saturday night and we have drop it off at a garage for repair. She borrows my car which decides to shred its back tire Sunday night during a raging thunderstorm and no one open to fix it because its a holiday week end,so we are now without a vehicle.\nMy wife reserves a car on line and no where on the website does it say you have to have a major credit card to rent car. Our daughter picks us up and we drive 45 minutes to the airport and [[wait]] in line only to be told when we present our debit card that we need a major credit card to rent a car. WTF!! A debit card is the same as cash and we are being turned down for a car rental???\nMy wife informed the clerk that she had used this same debit card in other cities to rent car while she was on business trips and at this point he takes a condescending attitude and told us we were not renting a car with a debit card.\nI kept my cool until the clerk starting waving my wife's debit card in our face and treating us like we were white trash because we did not have a credit card.\nAt this point both my wife and I lost it and I profanely told him what I thought of him and Enterprise care rental.

We [[took]] my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they [[covered]] most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad [[control]] module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a [[bad]] replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.

What a [[lousy]] experience.  Perhaps there was a reason they were so unprepared but as a regular Hertz Gold customer I was astonished at the disorganization of this facility. Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.

Since it was apparent something else would be [[quicker]] I took what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return experience on Friday afternoon was just as miserable - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight. \n\nFirst of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross. \n\nAnd then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz. If I didn't have TSA per-check Or had to check a bag, I'm not sure I would have made my flight. \n\nTotally unacceptable service - that's an oxymoron with Hertz Charlotte.

We were [[so]] disappointed so he called to tell the manager and she didn't [[offer]] us a better one or anything free next time.  It was just a [[waste]] of $10 because we couldn't eat it.

We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.\n\nI thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food has great [[flavors]] and think it is spot on.

My friend and I went last night to Bombay Grille. We started with samosa (she ordered and oh boy what a [[good]] choice). They are very [[filling]] and come as two [[big]] pieces. I ordered chicken palak. It's quite tasty but a little spicy for my taste. Next time note to self to order only #2. Luckily, the waiter was [[very]] prompt in refilling my drink. The garlic naan was sooo yummy! I can eat that for dinner with the sauce of Chicken Palak. I wish this place only 10 minutes away from my home...

Craving Thai-ish and need a quick lunch? Hit up Bangkok Ocha, son. \n\nI met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea, house soup and a noodle dish w/egg roll for $7.95. Oh, and it comes out in about 10 minutes flat. That's fast. \n\nAnd the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was [[quite]] tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat! \n\nThe service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte.

My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.

Great Way to Spend the 4th.\n\nBeen awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.\n\nMy wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.\n\nOnly negative was the bread they served. It was a very [[dark]] bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.\n\nMy Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.\n\nService was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.\n\nAtmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.\n\nIf you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch

So, I had to play hotel switcheroo because Hyatt's rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay. I wound up here and I [[think]] I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a [[positive]] experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.\n\nThis hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of [[garbage]] food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.\n\nThe beds are not [[comfortable]] at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15\"" pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\n\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward.

We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was [[average]] in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and [[forever]] for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that [[much]] based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have [[declined]] so [[much]] recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations.

My new [[coworkers]] invited me to go get \""cheap mexican\"" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \""cheap\"" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks.

This week, I took my son to see the \""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. Lines for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the [[INSIDES]] of theaters? This is one tradition that should [[be]] broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\n\nBUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""small\"" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""movie-NOT-going\"" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, \""Let's all go to the lobby\"" breaks.\n\nEvery time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.\n\nIt's a pity; you would think they would set the prices low enough to ensure all the seats are filled at most screenings. If they used some basic Economics 101 theory in their marketing model, and made a little on each of a lot of people, the total revenue would be maximized, and everyone would win. But as it is, they're losing more and more of us to the home theater market for 90+% of our movie-viewing dollars.

The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires.

My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not [[nice]] but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. [[We]] [[expect]] good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\"".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation.

I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so.

STAFF:  The most kind hotel staff I've had the chance to meet.  Atmosphere was down to earth, professional and efficient.  A well oiled staff no matter who was at the front desk.  All policies stayed the same from person to person.\n\nI'd like to make special mention of Joe (staffer), who didn't rush me off but listened to my request and immediately went into action to do research and obtain information about relocating to the area.  Joe was a positive person and nothing but a gentleman.  Southern hospitality DOES still exist!\n\nFACILITY:  NO noise!  I mean absolutely no noise from the hall or surrounding rooms.  Parking was plentiful and easily accessible; no long walks to your car.  The parking lot was well lit and I observed no shenanigans during my week stay.  \n\nCONVENIENCE STORE:  A pretty neat concept where you purchase necessities (Tide, Chips, Soda, etc.) and you are billed - - All on the Honor System!  Sweet!\n\nROOM:  The room was clean and smelled good.  I am very particular about cigarette smoke!  The bed slept like a Dream!  The room was spacious.  The full kitchen was convenient; included a refrigerator, stove, microwave, pots/pans, dishes, glasses, coffee cups and to go coffee cups, colander and a pyrex dish for microwavable items.\n\nMy only complaint was that I had NO cell service whatsoever while in the room to which I asked one of the hotel staff and they immediately asked if I had SPRINT which I do.  Wowzers!  That's definitely going to be another review.  Humpf!\n\nOverall my 7 day stay felt like I was right at home and it can't get any better than that!

I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you think, and is more than enough for most people (see pics).  \n\n*I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.\n\n*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.  In recent visits, I have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there.  \n\nThere's nothing NOT to like about Longhorn.  Reasonable prices, great food, and awesome service...what else do you need?

I'll [[chop]] right to the tender, [[lucrative]] heart of Longhorn...its a great chain steakhouse, and as far as I am concerned, it puts Outback to shame.

I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a [[decent]] environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was [[very]] hot. The chairs are [[old]] and not [[very]] effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not [[go]] back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though.

Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty [[much]] the only [[good]] thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was [[soaked]] up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also [[extremely]] salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but [[definitely]] not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nI went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. \n\nI know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've [[had]] more [[authentic]] Chinese food at Panda Express. What [[should]] have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the [[specific]] dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless. \n\nThe service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.\n\nI won't be going back.

I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and [[downright]] rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers.
